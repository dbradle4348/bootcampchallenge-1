# bootcampchallenge-1
1st Weekly Challenge Assignment

This is the first deployment of the requested Horiseon website. 
I made a few changes to the code, placing comments in the CSS document and creating header and footer tags on the HTML side for easier reading of the code itself. I started to change the <div> elements into >section> and <article> but found that it messed with the settings in a way that I didn't know how to quickly fix so I changed them back to <div> so that the deployed site would match the mockup as close as possible. Next, the HTML links on the header weren't working so I remade them and made sure they navigated to the correct sections.
  
The next problem I ran into that took me a long while to sort out was the github pages site only showed the readme file. This was because of the placement of the index.html file not being placed in the root folder. I deleted a couple of folders and put the index.html folder in the Challenge1 folder I created and I placed the readme in the assets folder with the CSS document and images. This worked after I pushed the changes to github and waited for them to process on the website. 

Screenshots of the website can be found here at these links:

As you can see in the images, the header contains links to the corresponding content of the same name. The deployed application can be found at the following link:
